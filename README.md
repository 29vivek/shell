# shell
a simple linux shell written in lex and yacc
based on the cs 252 course by Purdue University

To run, simply do:
# make
# ./shell

To cleanup do:
# make clean

Wildcard expansion, aliasing, and zombie elimination does not work.
TODO: up/down arrow support
Very basic shell, can be improved upon.
